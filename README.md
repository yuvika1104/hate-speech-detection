In this project i have Trained a machine learning model (Decision Tree Model along with TF-IDF Vectorizer for feature extraction) to detect hate speechwith an accuracy of 93.64% .


Moreover, i have used this model and made 3 different web application using streamlit to classify:
* Manually Typed Text (also detects profanities)
